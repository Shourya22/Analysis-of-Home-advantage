* The data consists of home and away points for the respective teams participating in the **English Premier League** for the seasons _2008/09_ to _2017/18_.  
* Normality tests are performed to check the validity of t-tests to be performed at a later stage.  
* When the normality assumptions doesn't hold, other non-parametric methods has been used to test for significant difference between the home and away points.  
* The necessary tests and results were performed using minitab and these files have been made available in the **Tables** folder.
